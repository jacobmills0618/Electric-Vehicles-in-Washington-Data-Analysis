# Electric-Vehicles-in-Washington-Data-Analysis

An Exploratory and Comparative Analysis on Electric Vehicles in Washington State.

# üöÄ Purpose

The purpose of this project was to experiment in representing large amounts of Data using basic Python fundamentals.  
Developing Skills in the following: Data Representation, Data Visualization, Comparative Analysis, Data Insight, Data Interpretation, Data Gathering.

# Summary

Using the tools listed above, I was able to create a table in python in which I could clean up and locate missing values, along with the areas to which they belong to. With simple refinement, I was then able to create a basic pie chart that visualized **The Top 10 Electric Vehicle Makes in the State of Washington.** For further visualization, using the same refined data set, I then prompted to create a barplot that displayed **The Top 10 Cities in Washington with the Most Amount of Electric Vehicles.** As added experience and challenge, I even went the extra mile to include the demonstration of folium, setting a visualize map that showed the concentrations of EV's in Washington using the longitude and latitude of each registered vehicle. With this information in hand, I decided to further analyze **Teslas in Seattle**, *the most popular EV Make in the city of the most amount of EV's in Washington*. In doing so, I was challenged to create my own data frame using information I'd gather online, most notably each make's kWh consumption through Tesla's website. Calculating both their average consumption and electric range, I was then able to determine the total consumption and cost of traveling this range. To provide an even deeper analysis, I created another data frame pertaining to *The Top 5 Gas Cars in Seattle* to compare with. In the end, I was able to gather the `Miles Per Gallon` of each car, `Total Gallons to Travel the Equivalent of Tesla's Average Electric Range`, and finally each car's `Fuel Cost`. Combining these two data frames in an alternating arrangement, I then translated it into a barplot that compared **The Top 5 Gas Cars** with **Tesla's 4 Models and 1 Combined Average.** My findings: a significant difference in cost between driving a traditional gas car vs. driving one of Tesla's models.

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Improvements 

During the process of this analysis, many assumptions were made in order to simplify the data. For example, gas prices were a calculated average from the BLS, the data of the top 5 popular cars being based on 2025 models, and an average of each Tesla model's consumption rather than a specific variation. Because of this, the data shown is more generalized rather than taking a specific case into consideration. As for rooms for improvement, perhaps one could include up-front costs of electric vehicles vs traditional gas cars, The total maintenance cost to own either electric or gas, and maybe even a comparative analysis on the different EV makes in different cities.
